Zeph's Mod: Frenzy Mode (Powerup that splits the ball in two)

Description: My mod generates a randomly positioned powerup which when actived, splits the ball in two. To achieve this, a postion for the powerup is randomly generated at the beginning of them game. During this time, the game will play like normal until the ball makes contact with the powerup. Once the powerup has been hit, the powerup will despawn and the ball will split in two. This mode is available in both single player and two player versions.

Why it Improves Gameplay: The gameplay experience in the base game isn't exactly challenging for most players. For the most part, anyone is able to pickup and learn the controls fairly quickly. With the addition of the second ball in "Frenzy Mode", the game now requires the players full attention in order to track both balls to keep from getting scored on. The addition of the second ball speeds up the moment to moment gameplay and holds the players attention better than the base game.
