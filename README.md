Ball-Split Powerup
This mod generates a randomly positioned powerup at a which when actived, splits the ball in two. To achieve this, a postion for the powerup is randomly generated at the beginning of them game. During this time, the game will play like normal until the ball makes contact with the powerup. Once the powerup has been hit, the powerup will despawn and the ball will split in two. There are sound effects for included for the powerup collision and collisions between the balls. This mode is available in both single player and thanks to Jordans code as a foundation, is also available in two player format

Why it Improves Gameplay 
The gameplay experience in the base game isn't exactly challenging for most players. For the most part, anyone is able to pickup and learn the controls fairly quickly. With the addition of the second ball in "Frenzy Mode", the game now requires the players full attention in order to track both balls to keep from getting scored on. The addition of the second ball speeds up the moment to moment gameplay and holds the players attention better than the base game. Plus if one ball in pong is fun, it stands to reason that two balls adds an increased challenge for seasoned players
